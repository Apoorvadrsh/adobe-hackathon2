# Adobe Hackathon Project: Enhanced Persona-Driven Document Analysis

## 🚀 The "Magic" PDF Experience

This enhanced solution transforms the humble PDF from a static document into an **intelligent, interactive experience** that understands context, adapts to user personas, and delivers precisely relevant information. Our system doesn't just extract text—it **thinks, understands, and personalizes** the reading experience.

## 🎯 Problem Statement & Our Solution

**The Challenge:** PDFs are ubiquitous but static. Users struggle to quickly find relevant information across large document collections, especially when their needs vary based on their role, expertise, and specific goals.

**Our Innovation:** We've created an AI-powered system that:
- **Understands Document Structure** with enhanced heading detection using advanced heuristics and multilingual support
- **Adapts to User Context** through persona-driven analysis that weights relevance based on user roles and objectives
- **Delivers Intelligent Insights** with semantic understanding, query expansion, and contextual summarization

## 🌟 What Makes This "Magic"

### Round 1A: Intelligent Outline Extraction
- **Beyond Simple Heuristics**: Advanced font analysis, spatial reasoning, and layout understanding

- **Multilingual Intelligence**: Automatic language detection with Unicode-aware processing
- **Performance Optimized**: Sub-10-second processing for 50-page documents with built-in profiling
- **Accuracy Validated**: Precision/recall metrics against ground truth with automated validation

### Round 1B: Persona-Driven Intelligence
- **Dynamic Relevance Weighting**: Algorithms that adapt based on user personas (researcher vs. executive vs. student)
- **Semantic Understanding**: Query expansion, entity recognition, and contextual keyword extraction
- **Intelligent Summarization**: Persona-aware text refinement that highlights what matters most to each user type
- **Scalable Analysis**: Efficient processing of 3-10 document collections within 60-second limits
